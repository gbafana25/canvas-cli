# canvas-cli

Shows list of upcoming assignments

## Setup

- Generate token from account settings page
	- Account > Settings > New Access Token
- Copy into file called `token`
- Run `./pycan.py setup` to create the config file
	- older courses that still show up need to be deleted manually

## Usage

Run `./pycan.py` with no arguments to fetch upcoming assignments


## TODO
- add option to show assignments without due date (now hardcoded not to)
